Contains little tidbits that I did
Hangman (Java)
  Allows you to play hangman
  Both hangman games use words.txt, which contains approximately 10,000 of the most common English words. I tried my best to filter out non-word strings
  HangmanGUI.java has a better GUI using Swing
  Hangman.java has the game in console using ASCII art

FibonacciSequence.java
  Simply an implementation of the closed-form equation for Fibonacci numbers
  Takes a natural number n and returns the nth Fibonacci number

GaussCircleProblem.java
  Simply an implementation of the Gauss Circle Problem, which counts the number of lattice points in a circle whose center is also a lattice point
  Takes a real number r for the radius of the circle and returns the number of lattice points in a circle with a lattice point center and radius r

Random Game of Life.cpp
  Implements John Conway's Game of Life. The board is a square, and the console prompts the user to type in the size of the square and the number of living cells, and it will generate a random board of that size with that number of living cells in random positions. Every time enter is pressed the code prints a new generation of the Game of Life
